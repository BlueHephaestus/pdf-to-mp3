# Description

As the description above states, this is a small  python script I made to easily create audio transcriptions of pdf files. 

I made it so I could read research papers without having to physically read through them, since I love audiobooks but unfortunately that doesn't exist for the tons of research papers I want to go through. Fortunately, the awesome peeps at LangChain and OpenAI have now made that possible!

Example included is on "Attention is all you need" by Vaswani et al. (2017), which is a paper on the Transformer architecture. I've included the audio transcription of the paper in the repo, and you can listen to it here.

### DEPRECATED

This code has been improved and moved into a more generic utils repository, you can find it here https://github.com/BlueHephaestus/utils
